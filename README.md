# Juke

## Setup project
1. Make sure you have the up to date version of the repo
2. In terminal, navigate into the Juke project folder and run 'pod install'
3. After running pod install open the Juke.xcworkspace. From now on you must always use the .xcworkspace file instead of the .xcodeproj file for dev
