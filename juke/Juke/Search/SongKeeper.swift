// this class is to keep a set of all the songs a user has added during
// any given "session" (visit) to the MyLibrary tab or Search tab so we
// the add song indicator doesn't sometimes flash between states -- better 
// alternative to always setting add button to enabled when cell is loaded.
// set is cleared whenever either of those tabs disappears
class SongKeeper {
